# Ranch-Control
It is a Full Stack Project that uses Node JS and the Express framework in the backend to create the data point routes. The endpoints support GET, POST, PUT and DELETE operations. Also, I make use of EJS templating language to generate HTML markup and manipulate it with JavaScript. For the frontend, I use Bootstrap 4 to create the visual elements.
